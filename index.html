        <h1> El Ritmo del Westside </h1>
        <p> Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, San Antonio’s historic westside fostered a unique musical landscape for the working-class community of mostly Mexicans and Chicanos that resided there. A predominantly low-income, Hispanic area shaped the musical trajectories of such talents as, Las Tesoros de San Antonio, The Royal Jesters, Lydia Mendoza, Lorenzo Martinez, and other local musicians while welcoming internationally-know acts such as Louis Armstrong and Nat King Cole, all of whom contributed to the bustling musical landscape of the city.</p>

          <p> This rich cultural and musical history, however, remains largely unknown and understudied, with limited documentation and resources that are easily accessible to the public. Additionally, much of the existing documentation has been performed under the auspices of criminal justice studies, focusing on the area’s histories with gang networks, violence, and crime. El Ritmo del Westside aims to explore San Antonio’s historic Westside, through a different lens, offering a look back in time to explore the unique musical landscape and exceptional musical talent that was born there.  </p>

      <h2> Shaping the Cultural Landscape </h2>
        <p>Let's take a look at some factors that shaped the culture and social life in San Antonio and, ultimately, the musical landscape.</p>
    </div>  

      <div class="box bL">
        <p> These figures might seem odd considering San Antonio's historically large Hispanic population. </p>
        
        1950 decennial records state the following regarding the definition of race: <p> <i>“Persons of Mexican birth or ancestry who were not definitely [American] Indian or of other nonwhite race were classified as white in 1950 and 1940.”</i> </p> 
        </div>

      <div class="box b"> <h3> Race (Bexar County)</h3> 
        <div id="race_legend"></div>
        <div id="Race_2"></div>
        <div id="Race_2_tooltip"></div>
      </div>

      <div class="box bR">
        Moreover, an individual's race was determined by census-takers (enumerators) until the 1960 census when people could select their own response. Still, 1960 census records for Bexar County indicate only three Race categories. So, it is likely that people of Mexican birth or ancestry continued to select White as their race.
      </div>

      <div class="box cTop">
        While race demographics are limited, the below figures on Bexar County's foreign population give us a better idea of San Antonio's Mexican population. There is a distinct pattern of Mexico being the top country of origin for the foreign population in the 1960 and 1970 census records.

      <div class="box e"> <h2> How Did this Translate to The Music? </h2>
        <p> The cross-cultural exchanges amongst San Antonio's racially diverse population can be heard in the popular music that thrived there. Below are some examples. Click on the circle to reveal more details and listen! </p>
        <p> <i>“Interestingly, beginning in the 1950s and early 1960s, an organic integration in the city manifested itself through the collaboration of racial and ethnic groups—Tejanos, African Americans, and Anglos—in a unique intercultural musical genre that became known as the West Side Sound. Young artists came together at night spots (such as the Eastwood Country Club) and house parties and combined elements of rock-and-roll, rhythm-and-blues, country, and conjunto to create a new sound that has resonated beyond the city and into the twenty-first century.”</i>

      <div class="box i"> <h2>Military City: Creating a Uniquely Diverse Environment</h2>
        <p> To the left, you can see the military facilities throughout San Antonio that were active during 1950-1970. </p>

        <p><i> “[The military presence] brought a new generation of young recruits from across the United States. Many returned to live in San Antonio after their service.” </i>-<a href="https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/san-antonio-tx" style="font-size:80%; text-align: right;">Laurie E. Jasinski </a></p>

        <p> With one of the largest concentrations of military facilities in the country, San Antonio drew people from various backgrounds, fostering an ethnically diverse environment of military and civilian residents. The diverse population, naturally, increased cross-cultural exchanges throughout various aspects of the culture and social life, including the music! </p>
        
        <p><i> “San Antonio’s West Side Sound stands as an example of the music that can be created when members of separate ethnic groups come together to collaborate.“ </i>-<a href="https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/west-side-sound" style="font-size:80%; text-align: right;">Alen O. Olsen </a></p>
