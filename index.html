        <p> Exploring the arrangement of social and cultural factors in San Antonio's Historic Westside during the 1950's and 1960's. This project aims to provide context on the social life in the area and, ultimately, connect the explored factors to the musical landscape as explored in <a href="https://valderete.github.io/El-Ritmo-del-Westside/">this project</a>. The project explores quantitative and qualitative data surrounding historical events that shaped San Antonio's demographic make-up, such as immigration data, socio-economic statistics, and information overviewing the proximity and number of military bases in San Antonio which ultimately fostered cross-cultural exchanges that influenced the city’s musical landscape. </p>

      <h2> Shaping the Cultural Landscape </h2>
        <p>Let's take a look at some factors that shaped the culture and social life in San Antonio and, ultimately, the musical landscape.</p>
    </div>  

      <div class="box bL">
        <p> These figures might seem odd considering San Antonio's historically large Hispanic population. </p>
        
        1950 decennial records state the following regarding the definition of race: <p> <i>“Persons of Mexican birth or ancestry who were not definitely [American] Indian or of other nonwhite race were classified as white in 1950 and 1940.”</i> </p> 
        </div>

      <div class="box b"> <h3> Race (Bexar County)</h3> 
        <div id="race_legend"></div>
        <div id="Race_2"></div>
        <div id="Race_2_tooltip"></div>
      </div>

      <div class="box bR">
        Moreover, an individual's race was determined by census-takers (enumerators) until the 1960 census when people could select their own response. Still, 1960 census records for Bexar County indicate only three Race categories. So, it is likely that people of Mexican birth or ancestry continued to select White as their race.
      </div>

      <div class="box cTop">
        While race demographics are limited, the below figures on Bexar County's foreign population give us a better idea of San Antonio's Mexican population. There is a distinct pattern of Mexico being the top country of origin for the foreign population in the 1960 and 1970 census records.

      <div class="box i"> <h2>Military City: Creating a Uniquely Diverse Environment</h2>
        <p> To the left, you can see the military facilities throughout San Antonio that were active during 1950-1970. </p>

        <p><i> “[The military presence] brought a new generation of young recruits from across the United States. Many returned to live in San Antonio after their service.” </i>-<a href="https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/san-antonio-tx" style="font-size:80%; text-align: right;">Laurie E. Jasinski </a></p>

        <p> With one of the largest concentrations of military facilities in the country, San Antonio drew people from various backgrounds, fostering an ethnically diverse environment of military and civilian residents. The diverse population, naturally, increased cross-cultural exchanges throughout various aspects of the culture and social life, including the music! </p>
        
        <p><i> “San Antonio’s West Side Sound stands as an example of the music that can be created when members of separate ethnic groups come together to collaborate.“ </i>-<a href="https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/west-side-sound" style="font-size:80%; text-align: right;">Alen O. Olsen </a></p>

        <h2> How Did this Translate to The Music?</h2>
        <p> The cross-cultural exchanges amongst San Antonio's racially diverse population can be heard in the popular music that thrived there. Below are some examples. Click on the circle to reveal more details and listen! </p>
        <p> <i>“Interestingly, beginning in the 1950s and early 1960s, an organic integration in the city manifested itself through the collaboration of racial and ethnic groups—Tejanos, African Americans, and Anglos—in a unique intercultural musical genre that became known as the West Side Sound. Young artists came together at night spots (such as the Eastwood Country Club) and house parties and combined elements of rock-and-roll, rhythm-and-blues, country, and conjunto to create a new sound that has resonated beyond the city and into the twenty-first century.”</i>
