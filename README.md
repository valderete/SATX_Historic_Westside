# San Antonio's Historic Westside
## A preface to https://valderete.github.io/El-Ritmo-del-Westside/
This project seeks to inform people on the arrangement of social and cultural factors in San Antonio's Historic Westside during the 1950's and 1960's, to provide context on the social life and ultimately connect these factors to the music as explored in <a href="https://valderete.github.io/El-Ritmo-del-Westside/" style="font-size:80%;">this project</a>. The project explores quantitative and qualitative data surrounding historical events that shaped San Antonio's demographic make-up, such as immigration data, socio-economic statistics, and information overviewing the proximity and number of military bases in San Antonio which ultimately fostered cross-cultural exchanges that influenced the cityâ€™s musical landscape.
